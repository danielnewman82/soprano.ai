# soprano.ai
Backend coding test for soprano.ai / Mintbeanz

Conveniently, I had already implemented the bulk of these steps in the backend code for Hoodlum. I just had to add a few features that weren't needed for that application, and a few tweaks and modifications for this purpose. I'm sure there are a few things that would need further tweaking to work properly, but I know most of it does: just add a .env with MongoDB URIs and a JWT secret, and let 'er rip. In my defense, the instructions are rather terse and vaguely worded, so I did what I could in a reasonable time frame. Constructive criticism would be absolutely welcome; I always want to know what I got wrong so I can learn to do better. This would be my first SWE job, so surely I will need a bit of coaching to get up to speed.
